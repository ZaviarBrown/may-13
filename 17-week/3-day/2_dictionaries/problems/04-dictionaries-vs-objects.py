# In this problem, you'll explore the difference between a dictionary in Python
# and a plain-old JavaScript object. Try declaring a dictionary representing a
# cat using the same notation as you would in JavaScript, with the properties
# for `name`, `breed`, and `age`.

# Did you run into any errors executing your code? Try adding or removing
# quotations around the keys in your dictionary and see what effect that may
# have.

# d1 = {module: "Python 3", subject: "Dictionaries"} #! Doesn't work :(
# d2 = {"module": "Python 3", "subject": "Dictionaries"}

name = "most_played"  # ? const name = "mostPlayed"

game_obj = {name: "Elden Ring"}  # ? const gameObj = { [name]: "Elden Ring" }

print(game_obj)
