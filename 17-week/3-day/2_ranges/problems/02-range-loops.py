# It's time to practice writing a `for` loop with the `range` in Python. As
# you've seen, the syntax is similar to JavaScript, except using `:` at the end
# of the loop definition and indentation for the block of code to run with that
# loop.

# Powers of 2 from 1 to 16
# Write a for loop that uses the range function to
# print the powers of 2 from 2 - 65536, that is
# from 2^1st - 2^16th powers

for x in range(1, 17):
    print(2**x)
