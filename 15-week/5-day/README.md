# Project Requirement Overview

## Scorecard is your guiding light

- 90% passing Auth specs
- 90% passing App specs
- No High/Critical Category bugs
- No more than 4 Medium Category bugs
  - (see [bug chart](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-may-2023-online/week-30---redux-thunk-and-authentication/react-solo-project-scorecard))

## Wireframe is just a suggestion

- "The layout and element positioning is equivalent to the wireframe's"
  - The structure of the page should match the wireframe
  - All other styling is fair game
- When in doubt, follow the scorecard
  - Notify me of any conflicts

## Developers !== Designers

- Styling should come after all functionality
- Only requirement is "no defaults"

## Your GitHub repo deserves attention too

- Main README present (partially complete)
- Redux state outline (partially complete)
- API routes (reuse from Mod 4 project)
- DB Schema (reuse from Mod 4 project)
