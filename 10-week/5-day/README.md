# Quick here's more info that's not on the assessment!

## Aggregates & Subqueries

Not needed for our assessment, but _can_ be used, and we'll use them more starting next week

### Aggregates - Functions used for math things

- `COUNT()` - The number of entries
- `MIN()` - The lowest value
- `MAX()` - The highest value
- `SUM()` & `TOTAL()` - Adds up the values
- `AVG()` - The average of the values

### Subqueries - Using multiple queries at once to `INSERT` dynamically or replace `JOIN`s

- Yo dawg
- I heard you like `queries`
- So I put a `query`
- In your `query`
- So you can `query`
- While you `query`
